        <p>A classic crowd pleaser. I actually made this cheesecake myself, it was my first cheesecake. It came out pretty 
        good, so I'd say this is a great beginner's recipe. I personally thought the topping was a bit much, and would use less
        of it next time around; however, my partner and his kiddo thought it was great. </p>
